/* THE ALGORITHM
 1-  Include necessary libraries:
  Include the necessary libraries such as iostream and string.

 1-  Declare variables:
 Declare variables to store input terms (term1, term2, term3, term4), operations (operation1, operation2, operation3), and a choice variable for continuing calculations.

 2-  Print welcome message:
  Display a welcome message indicating that the user has entered the rational number calculator.

 3-  Main Loop:
 Enter into a loop that continues until the user decides to exit.

 4-  Prompt for operation:
 Prompt the user to enter an operation.

 5-  Input handling:
 Read the input operation and terms from the user. Check for input errors, invalid operations, and division by zero. If any error is encountered, display an appropriate error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.

 6-  Perform calculation:
 Perform the requested arithmetic operation on the rational numbers. Display the result along with an approximate rounded value.

 7-  Prompt for continuation:
 Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation. If the user chooses not to continue, exit the loop.

 8-  Exit the program:
 Return 0 to indicate successful execution and exit.*/
